    <h2><u>General Information</u></h2>
    <p>Pearl Harbor is a harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, west of Honolulu. On December 7 of 1941, it became the site of a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base just before 8 in the morning. The Japanese referred to this operation as "Operation Hawaii", "Operation Al" and "Opeartion Z" during its plannings. It was because of this attack, the USA decided to defer from its neutrality in WW2 and decided to join The Allies to fight against The Axis power.</p>

    <h2><u>The Attack on Pearl Harbour</u></h2>
    <h3>What happened during the attack?</h3>
    <p>Pearl Harbour was attacked by nearly 200 Imperial Japanese aircrafts on the first wave. Various airfields at the harbour were attacked. On one of the airfields, of the 126 planes present, 42 were destroyed completely, 41 were damaged and only 43 left fit for use. Only 6 USA aircrafts got to repel the attackers of the first wave.</p>
    <p>Although the second wave of attacks was less successful than the first wave, it still inflicted some very serious damage. The battleship USS Pennsylvania was set ablaze by the bombs and 2 destroyers neared it were destroyed to wrecks as well. The destroyer USS Shaw was also split in half by a great explosion.</p>

     <h3>Why did Japan attack Pearl Harbour?</h3>
     <p>Japan had been modernising their economy during the 20th century and wanted to build an empire. Since Japan lacked natural resources, therefore having to invade other countries for their resources. When Japan took over French indochina, USA retaliated by freezing Japan's assests as USA is a close ally to France. Having lost 94% of their oil, Japan planned to take the oil by force. They wanted to attack British Malay and the Dutch East indies but it would most certainly provoke the USA. To blunt this response, the decision was for Japan to attack USA's Pearl Harbour, hoping that USA would negotiate for peace.</p>

     <h3>Who were involved in the attack of Pearl Harbour?</h3>
     <p>Prime Minister Tojo Hideki decided on the surpirse attack on Pearl Harbour. Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku, the commander in cheif of Japan's combined fleet, planned the attack on Pearl Harbour very carefully. On November 26th, Vice Admiral Nagumo Chuichi led a fleet that had 6 aircraft carries, 2 battleships, 3 cruisers and 11 destroyers 400+ kilometres to Pearl Harbour.</p>

     <h3>How did the attack happen?</h3>
     <p>The plan was devised by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the plan was to surprise attack against the USA at Pearl Harbour. This plan was to cripple USA's naval power in the pacific, making it easier for Japan to take the rest of Southeast Asia. Throughout their journey across the Pacific, they made strict radio silence to avoid getting detected, making this a true sneak attack. When they approached the Hawaiian Islands, they launched an aircraft to scout for American naval vessels locations and assess the defenses at Pearl Harbour. At approximately 7.48am, the Japanese launched their surprise attack. They targetted battleships, cruisers, destroyers, aircraft, and military installations around the harbor. This dealt heavy damage on the American Pacific Fleet, destroying many battleships, aircraft and military installations. On the second wave, they targetted remaining ships and to maximise the damage so the USA couldn't retaliate whatsoever.</p>



     <h3>What was the impact of this attack?</h3>
     <p> The attack on Pearl Harbor took the lives and damage for the United States, with over 2,400 Americans killed and numerous ships and aircraft destroyed or incapacitated. This attack caused The United States to declare war on Japan, officially entering World War II, joining The Allies (British Empire, French Empire) to fight against The Axis (Nazi Germany, Italy and Imperial Japan).</p>

     <h3>Admiral Yamamoto's decision.</h3>
     <p> Was it really wise for Adm. Yamamoto to decide to bomb Pearl Harbour, knowing that the USA at that time was the world's leading global superpower? I think it was unwise for Adm. Yamamoto to attack Pearl Harbour. Japan aimed to cripple America's navy in the pacific to have an easy way to take over Southeast Asia. Although the attack had short-term success such as heavy damage on the Pacific Fleet, including the destruction or incapacitation of several battleships and aircraft. However, Adm. Yamamoto failed to realise the long-term consequence this attack will bring. Attacking Pearl Harbour brought the USA into the war against themselves. By bringing the USA into the war, Japan had to face the world's top global superpower, having vast industrial and military capabilities. The USA ultimately led Japan to surrender and ended the war. </p>

     <h4> Diary Entry 1: December 7, 1941 </h4>
     <p> The peacefulness of the morning in Pearl Harbour was soon shattered as the thundering roars of aircrafts and defeaning sounds of explosions. I quickly went outside to be witness a horrifying scene of utter destruction and chaos. A truly horrific scene nothing less of an absolute catclysm. Japanese planes that had emblems of the rising sun on their wings, flew over naval bases, raining down bombs and torpedoes onto ships. The USS Arizona, engulfed in flames, belched smoke into the sky as sailors rushed to protect their ships. Pearl Harbour has became a site of an absolute cataclysm. </p>

     <h4> Diary Entry 2: December 7, 1941 (Aftermath) </h4>
     <p> In the aftermath of the attack, the extent of the damage becomes painfully clear. Countless lifeless bodies of our fallen comrades lay on the ground, stains of blood still visible aroudn them. I was truly fortunate to be able to survive. The traumatic scene in front of me sent chills down my spine. Countless of ships were destroyed till unrecognizable, facilities completely destroyed. Emergency crews are working endlessly to rescue survivors and extinguish fires, but the scale of the destruction is too overwhelming. </p>

     <h4> Diary Entry 3: December 8, 1941 </h4>
     <p>Following the attack of Pearl Harbour, the USA has decided to involve itself in WW2 as one of the Allies, declaring war against Japan. The USS Arizona, a symbol of America's naval prowess, lies destroyed among the waves, hundreds of brave soldiers and sailors lying dead around the sunken ship. This act of aggression from those scums has not brought down our moral however, it has united us, determined to defend our nation at all costs. </p>

     <h4> Diary Entry 4: December 9, 1941 </h4>
     <p> Despite facing all the traumas, witnessing a full blown the harbour is busy as crew members try to salvage and repair slightly less damaged ships. One of the ships, the USS Nevada, somehow survived despite being hit multiple times, it is now being towed to repairs. On top of that, the search for survivors hasn't stopped since yesterday. Civillians such me also are working on to rebuilding the harbour. </p>

     <h4> Diary Entry 5: December 10, 1941 </h4>
     <p> Slowly but surely, the shock of the attack from the world has faded away. The USA's main goal now is to start mobiliizing for war. Fleet of ships and millitary personnel rush across the pacific towards Japan, ready for their annex of Imperial Japan. Civillians like me, who aren't able to fight, volunteer to give aid in the relief efforts. We donated food, blood, and supplies to support all the soldiers.

     <h4> Diary Entry 6: December 11, 1941 </h4>
     <p> The debris and smoke have finally cleared away, Pearl Harbor now symbolizes America's indomitable resilliance in face of adversity. I must admit that the surprise attack has taken a huge toll on our military, but it has served to strengthen our determination to help our nation. Though the road of war ahead may be long and painful, we as a nation shall never stop believing and help the soldiers who are battling for the sake of all civillians, to ensure that the country would be able to see another day.
